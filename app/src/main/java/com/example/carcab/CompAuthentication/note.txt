This directory/folder houses:

- Models
- ViewModels
- Repository

to interact with activities and fragments.

The Authentication feature authored by yours (@elysian-dawnbreaker) uses (or tries to)
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture
to provide separation of concerns as well as to separate logic away from the view as much as possible.

In other words, I am grouping components together that provide similar purpose so that its
easy to manage this whole thang.

Why? Gone are the days of having code all over place. Time to attempt an organized code (even though
its first time) because why not.
