This directory/folder houses:

- Models
- ViewModels

to interact with activities and fragments.

The Authentication feature authored by yours truly uses (or tries to) MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture
to provide separation of concerns and separate logic away from the view.

In other words, I am grouping components together that provide similar purpose so that its
easy to manage this whole thang.
